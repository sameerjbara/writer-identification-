The Handwriting Recognition using Neural Networks project is designed to identify individuals by their handwriting. It utilizes image processing techniques and deep learning neural networks to recognize and distinguish unique handwriting styles.

Features
Preprocess handwritten text data to remove noise and artifacts.
Train a deep neural network using a pre-trained model for feature extraction.
Evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset.
Analyze misclassifications to improve recognition accuracy.
