Description
The Handwriting Recognition using Neural Networks project is designed to identify individuals by their handwriting. It utilizes image processing techniques and deep learning neural networks to recognize and distinguish unique handwriting styles.

Features
Preprocess handwritten text data to remove noise and artifacts.
Train a deep neural network using a pre-trained model for feature extraction.
Evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset.
Analyze misclassifications to improve recognition accuracy.



Model Training: Run the code to preprocess the data, train the neural network, and evaluate its performance. Adjust hyperparameters as needed.

Evaluation: Review the test accuracy and confusion matrix to assess the model's performance.

Visualization: analyze misclassifications to improve the model.

Data Preparation
Prepare your handwritten text data and peak data in specific directories.
Customize data paths and directory structure in the code.
Model Training
Define hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, and epochs.
Customize the neural network architecture as needed.
Train the model on your dataset and monitor training progress.
Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrices.
Identify areas of improvement based on the evaluation results.
Visualization
Visualize filters in the neural network's first convolutional layer to understand feature extraction.
Analyze misclassifications to gain insights into model behavior.
